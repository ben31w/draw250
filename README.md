# Overview
Drawing application where users can draw circles, rectangles, etc. on a blank canvas, and save and open their work.

# File structure
To use the program, run the file `draw250.py`.

The project uses class heirarchy to support the various shapes the user can draw. The classes are contianed in the files `shape.py`, `circle.py`, `ellipse.py`, `rectangle.py`, and `square.py`.

Drawings are saved as binary `.dwg` files. To view these files, open them in the draw250 program (File -> Open -> [select file to display]).
