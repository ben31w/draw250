# Overview

This lab using Classes and TkInter .

In this lab we will be working in pairs using *pair programming*.

You should only work with your partner doing pair programming.
Your presence in lab is required to receive participation credit.

In the very unlikely (Fall 2020) event that you are scheduled to miss any days due to approved travel (e.g. sports),
let your instructor know today so that pairing can be adjusted accordingly.


****
Project Coding Exercises
====

We will modify the provided `draw250.py` and `circle.py`code to extend the drawing program.

The modified code should allow creation of : `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Rectangle`, and `Square` shapes.

For extra challenge add arbitrary `Polygon` and `Arc` shapes.

You must add a `File` menu that includes:
* `New` - clear canvas 
* `Open` - allow selection of previously saved file (use `dwg` extension and tkInter filedialog) 
* `Save` - resave using the current file name (if available, otherwise select file name)
* `Save As` - select a new file name (use tkInter filedialog)
The modified code should allow saving and loading shapes from a file browser menu.

You must allow the user to select the desired edge color

You and your assigned partner must demonstrate the code and explain its operation in detail 
to your lab instructor by the assigned deadline.

You participation grade will be based on the ability of either partner to fully explain the code.

This work must be the complete individual effort of the assigned partner;
 no outside help other than what is freely available on the Internet is allowed.
 You *may* consult online examples and documentation, but must cite any resources used
 in your comments.
 
Submit your code to gitlab along with a saved `dwg` file.

If I clone your project, I should be able to load your saved file and recreate your screen shot.

You are free to redesign the user interface so long as you provide all of the required functionality.
